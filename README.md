# ProjectRobo
Project Robotica for the study TI

For this project have we been asked to make a autonomeous robot. We came up with a plan that we wanted to make a selfplaying four on a row robot. Where you can play against. 
We want to accomplish this with the use of Computer Vision and AI. The part of AI we made in JAVA and the CV we did in Python. :

For the hardware we used a Raspberry Pi with suitable camera to take the pictures.
